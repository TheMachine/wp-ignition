WordPress Ignition

This is an ongoing personal project, using the awesome starter theme _Underscores and hacking it up to create my own blank/starter theme. Integrating Bootstrap and Zurb's Foundation as possible framework options, using sass as the css preprocessor and creating basic styles for each page in the theme.

Why?

Because I am tired of re-creating the same theme pages and structure every time I start a new project. :P
